Linux has been my primary operating system since my university days. At first, the [GNOME desktop environment](https://www.gnome.org/) met my needs perfectly. Its polished and user-friendly design made it easy to be productive without requiring extensive setup.

As I gained more experience with Linux, I began to seek greater efficiency and customization. I discovered a vast world beyond conventional desktop environments.

In pursuit of a keyboard-centric workflow, I found [i3WM](https://i3wm.org/), a lightweight tiling window manager known for its flexibility. I could tailor themes, keyboard shortcuts, and nearly every aspect of my setup. To further enhance my experience, I incorporated several tools:

- [Terminator Terminal Emulator](https://gnome-terminator.org/)
- [Rofi Application Launcher](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- [Bumblebee Status Bar](https://bumblebee-status.readthedocs.io/en/main/)
- [Nitrogen](https://github.com/l3ib/nitrogen)
- [Oh My Bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash)

Check out this video where I demonstrate my configuration:

After a year of using i3WM, I finally transitioned to [Niri](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri). Niri is a scrolling tiling compositor developed in the [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org). I appreciate its ability to provide endless horizontal scrolling, allowing me to have numerous windows on the same horizontal workspace. It also supports infinite vertical scrolling for switching between workspaces. Additionally, I can navigate through all windows across workspaces using the familiar Alt+Tab key combination that I have grown accustomed to in GNOME and other desktop environments.

I addition to that, I am using almost the same key combinations from my config in i3wm. Here are the tools I integrated into the setup. 
- [Terminator Terminal Emulator](https://gnome-terminator.org/)
- [Rofi Application Launcher](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- [Swaybg for wallpapers](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg)
- [Swaylock for a lock screen](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock)
- [Noctalia shell](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell)

In conclusion, my experience with Niri has been fantastic. It offers a seamless and contemporary approach to window tiling. While I have enjoyed using i3WM, I believe it's time for a more modern solution, and I plan to make Niri my daily driver moving forward. I've successfully migrated my configuration for keybindings, themes, and my entire setup to Niri, and I'm thoroughly pleased with it.
