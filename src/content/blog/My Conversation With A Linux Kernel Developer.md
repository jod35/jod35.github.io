At PyCon Uganda 2025, I was thrilled to engage in numerous conversations with developers from diverse fields. One highlight was my discussion with [Dan Carpenter](https://github.com/error27), a Linux kernel developer . 
<!-- more --> Dan maintains [Smatch](https://github.com/error27/smatch), a [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) tool that helps C programmers debug their code without running it. We talked about his experiences as an open-source developer.

The video above is our conversation.
