I recently had the opportunity to appear on a podcast with [Kfir Gizman](https://kfir-g.dev/) for an insightful discussion about software development. Our conversation covered various aspects of the field, and despite feeling initially unprepared, I managed to share valuable insights and perspectives. I also discussed some of my non-conventional views on current software development practices.

During the interview, I covered:
- My journey into programming
- FastAPI framework
- Tools and technologies I use in my daily workflow
- My thoughts on becoming a better software engineer (still learning myself)

I need to make a correction from our discussion: AIOHTTP is not an ASGI-based web framework as I mentioned, but rather an HTTP implementation built on asyncio. The actual ASGI frameworks include FastAPI, Sanic, Litestar, and Starlette (which is the foundation that FastAPI is built upon).
