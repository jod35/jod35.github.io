# FastAPI Beyond CRUD

[This course material](https://jod35.github.io/fastapi-beyond-crud-docs/site/) is tailored for my FastAPI Framework course. FastAPI has quickly emerged as one of Python's leading frameworks <!-- more --> for crafting server-side web applications. I'm excited to present this comprehensive course, dedicated to helping you understand API development with FastAPI. I trust you'll find immense value in it as we delve into the complexities of building robust APIs.
