This video is one I made to show my Linux Setup for work and software development.

## Window Manager & Theming

I use **i3** as my window manager for its simplicity and keyboard-driven workflow. My entire desktop is themed with the **Dracula** color scheme, which I apply to i3, GTK, and terminal applications for a consistent look. For window transparency and effects, I run **picom** as my compositor.

## Application Launcher

For quickly launching applications, I rely on **rofi**. It's lightweight, highly customizable, and fits perfectly with my Dracula-themed setup.

## Terminal & Tools

My terminal of choice is **Terminator** because of its split panes and easy configuration. I use **pyenv** to manage multiple Python versions, which is essential for working on different projects.

## Development Utilities

- **LazyDocker**: A simple terminal UI for managing Docker containers and images.
- **Git**: For version control, integrated with my terminal and editors.
- **VS Code** or **Neovim**: Depending on the project, I switch between these editors, both themed with Dracula.

This setup keeps my workflow efficient, visually cohesive, and highly customizable for programming on Linux.
