Contributing to open source should come from a place of genuine passion for the project, tool, or framework, not merely as a means to an end like landing a job or gaining opportunities. Open source is a community driven by care and enthusiasm for the software we use daily. Whether it’s a text editor, a video player, or any other tool that sparks joy.

Instead of approaching open source with an expectation of immediate rewards, immerse yourself in projects you love. Start by reading their documentation, exploring GitHub issues, and identifying ways to contribute meaningfully. Many successful open source contributors I’ve spoken with began with a deep passion for the project, and benefits like recognition or paid opportunities followed naturally as a byproduct of their dedication.

This perspective might seem gatekeeping, but it’s not about exclusion. It’s about finding projects you’d contribute to even without compensation. Invest your time and effort in those, and with consistent contributions, recognition will come organically.
