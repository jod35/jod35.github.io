[VueJS](http://vuejs.org) is a frontend framework known as the "progressive web framework for building user interfaces."

As someone who isn't a frontend developer and struggled with it, I previously worked with React in 2021 and 2022. I found React frustrating, as it demanded a deep understanding of advanced JavaScript, and its documentation felt unfriendly, leaving me confused about what I was doing.

Now, in 2025, I'm working on personal projects outside my professional work and need a simple way to handle JavaScript on the frontend. That's when I discovered VueJS, and I absolutely love it. It's easy to learn, and the ability to use it in a Django template without a build system has made it a game-changer for me. 

VueJS has sparked my enthusiasm for frontend development, likely because it feels so close to working directly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clear separation of concerns is fantastic and makes the process intuitive.

I created a video where I built a simple Todo-list app to demonstrate the core concepts of using VueJS. While itâ€™s not a complex full-stack project like the "Uber clones" or "YouTube clones" often seen on YouTube, my goal was to explain the fundamentals and highlight how easy it is to get started with VueJS.
