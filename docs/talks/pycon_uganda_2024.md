## My First Experience Speaking at PyCon

Last year, I had the incredible opportunity to speak at PyCon Uganda 2024. As someone who has attended many conferences as a participant, stepping onto the stage as a speaker for the first time was both exciting and nerve-wracking.

### Preparing for the Talk

The preparation process was intense. I spent weeks refining my slides, practicing my delivery, and anticipating questions from the audience. I wanted to make sure my talk was engaging and informative, and that it would resonate with both beginners and experienced Python developers.

### The Day of the Talk

On the day of my talk, I arrived early to get comfortable with the venue. The support from the PyCon Uganda team was fantastic—they made sure everything ran smoothly. As the time reached for my talk, I felt a mix of nerves and excitement.

Once I started speaking, my nerves quickly faded. The audience was attentive and supportive, and I could see people nodding along and taking notes. Sharing my experiences and insights with the community was incredibly rewarding.

### Lessons Learned

Speaking at PyCon taught me a lot about communication, preparation, and the power of community. I received thoughtful questions and feedback that helped me see my topic from new perspectives. 

### Looking Ahead

I’m grateful for the experience and encourage anyone considering submitting a talk to go for it! It’s a fantastic way to grow, learn, and give back to the community.
