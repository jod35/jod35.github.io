# About Me.

My name is Ssali Jonathan Kiggundu. I am a software engineer from Uganda. Besides my professional work, I also teach programming on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@SsaliJonathan). Here, I will share some content I create as well as my thoughts, because this is my part of the big pie that is the internet.
